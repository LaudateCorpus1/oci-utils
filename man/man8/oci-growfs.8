.TH OCI-GROWFS 8 "AUG 2018" Linux "User Manuals"
.SH NAME
/usr/libexec/oci-growfs \- grow the boot volume to its configured size in a compute instance in the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure. 
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B oci-growfs [-h] [-y|-n]
.SH DESCRIPTION
When you create a compute instance, you can specify its boot volume >= 50GB (default minimum size). But when the compute instance is started, the boot volume is only shown and mounted with the default minimum size (50GB) inside the instance, even if you have configured more than that. 
The purpuse of the
.B oci-growfs
utility is to extend the current "/" root partition to fully utilize the allocated boot volume size. 
Running inside a compute instance in the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure, it requires root privilege.
