.TH OCI-GROWFS 8 "AUG 2018" Linux "User Manuals"
.SH NAME
/usr/libexec/oci-growfs \- expand a filesystem to its configured size in a compute instance in the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure.

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B oci-growfs [-h] [-y|-n]

.SH DESCRIPTION
When a compute instance is created with a boot volume >= 50GB (default minimum size), or is resized to a larger size, the instance does not automatically use the entire volume.  By default, the boot volume will only extend to the minimum size (50GB).

The purpuse of the
.B oci-growfs
script is to expand the root partition to fully utilize the allocated boot volume size.
When the partition already extends to the entire volume, no changes are made to the system.
The script is normally called by
.BR ocid
when the instance boots, but it can be run manually.
You can use the
.B auto_resize
setting in the
.B [iscsi]
section in
.BR oci-utils.conf.d(5)
to enable or disable this functionality.

For LVM based root filesystem, oci-growfs only support Logical Volume created on Logical Group
built with only one Physical volume.

.B oci-growfs
must be run on a compute instance in the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure, and it requires root privilege.

Note: in the current release only the root filesystem can be resized using
.B oci-growfs.
